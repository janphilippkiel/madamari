The embassy will contact the immigration authority electronically during the visa process. The immigration authority will then check again whether all requirements have been met. To do this, the immigration authority contacts the German partner and usually asks them to submit proof of income and rent/property. At this point, a declaration of commitment would also be issued for the Thai partner. However, as this is valid for entry in the next 6 months after the date of issue, it is advisable to do this before the visa application. The necessary documents for the immigration authority can also be sent proactively to the right clerk to speed up the process. As two authorities are involved, neither of which can or want to provide information about the duration, it takes 2-3 months before the visa can be issued.","documents_for_registry": "Documents for the registry office:",
